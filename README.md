Tracing Filaments in the Cosmic Web

This project investigates the large-scale structure of the universe by identifying and analyzing cosmic filamentsâ€”thread-like formations of galaxies and dark matter that connect galaxy clusters. Using Python and cosmological simulation data, I apply the **Friends-of-Friends (FoF)** algorithm to trace these filaments and visualize their distribution.

Objectives
- Detect filamentary structures in simulated cosmological data  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the FoF algorithm for filament tracing  
- Visualize the cosmic web and interpret its physical significance

Why It Matters
Understanding the cosmic web helps us decode how matter is distributed across the universe and how galaxies evolve over time. This project bridges data science and astrophysics, offering insights into the hidden scaffolding of the cosmos.

Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
